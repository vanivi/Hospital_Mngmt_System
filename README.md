Hospital Management System is an application which consists of different roles and admins who are able to go through data effectively. This project can be used on a large scale in Hospitals to manage the users. 
Users such as patients can login, system admins can create, update, read, delete data, doctors can record their encounters with patients in a single application, this is beneficial in terms of data handling.

I have created this application on Netbeans using Java Swing. The User interface is designed in such a way that is easy to navigate through different screens.

Things which were mandatory to add in this project are as followed:-

-> All inputs should have Data Validation.

-> Patients can look for different hospitals in the Community and also different doctors available in that Hospital.

-> Doctors are able to diagnose and leave encounter record based on vital signs.

–> Community administrators have the power to change the data pertaining to a community.

–> System administrators have complete control over all resources in this application (CRUD).

–> Logging in and Logging out is available for switching roles between the different type of users.
